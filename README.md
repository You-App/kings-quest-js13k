# kings-quest-js13k

This is an attempt to port the classic graphic adventure game, King's Quest: The Quest for the Crown to HTML5 using the rules of the js13kgames contest.

##Why am I doing this?##

For a number of reasons. I've always been a big fan of the old 3D animated graphic adventure games created by Lucasfilm and Sierra Online. Nobody has really attempted to create a full graphic adventure for the js13kgames contest, and so for 2017 I am hoping to do just that. One of the goals of this project is to port an existing graphic adventure over to JavaScript using the js13kgames restrictions so that a reusable engine can be built in the process and will therefore be ready to use to create a new adventure game story when 2017's theme is announced.

As I progress, I will no doubt encounter many problems with the size limitation. The original KQ1 game was at least 20 times as big as 13k. But most of that space was taken up by the graphics. If we can simply that as much as possible, and focus only on the core game puzzles, we might have a chance to pull it off. We have the benefit of many things that the browser proves for free. We have a much higher resolution, many more colours, and built in z-index features. We can give the impression of appearing picturesque but keeping the graphics flat and simple.

I'm also doing this because I'm aware that the 35th anniversary of King's Quest is coming up in 2018. So this will be a tribute project. KQ1 was the game that started the whole graphic adventure genre. Never before had an adventure game featured a person that could be moved around the screen in a seemingly 3D scene, walking both behind and in front of objects. Lucasfilm followed suit with Maniac Mansion but Sierra Online kicked things off.

If I can, I'd like to also incoporate some aspects of Maniac Mansion as well, so that it acts both as a tribute to the first Sierra Online graphic adventure and the first Lucasfilm graphic adventure. It will probably end up as a hybrid, but focussing mainly on the King's Quest story.
